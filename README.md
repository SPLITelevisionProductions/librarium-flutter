# librarium-flutter
[Future] Experimental native app support for Librarium using Flutter (https://flutter.io/)

This will link into librarium-sqlite, which returns JSON from most database queries. Due to this, it will be incompatible with the original librarium which only returns HTML, and existing databases will have to be migrated.

Before work can fully start on this, the web version needs to be complete to the point where most of the PHP backend scripts are completed and are accepting and outputting JSON, hence "future".

Flutter is a new SDK from Google which aims to be easy to use and can produce applications for iOS and Android using the same code base.
